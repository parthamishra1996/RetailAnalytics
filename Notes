Tasks
1. Customer history dictionary
2. Item Tree
3. Read about stemming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming
4. Check out other references.
5. Make a fact table.
6. Outlier elimination
SubTasks

1. Create a tree representation for visualization.
2. Relation btw product variety in a branch(SKU) vs participation of branch in baskets. (Check skewness)
3. Clustering: K-means and variations
			   Rank order clustering?
			   Direct clustering and other m/c part clustering algos?
4. Should PCA be used over binary data
5. Number of clusters evaluation using SSE. Any other method possible?

Aim: Basket per visit and clustering

Data Info:
1. Online retail
2. Every customer has an ID, whnever he views, adds to car or purchases an item he creates an event.
3. This item has several properties and values (like which category id, price, etc. which changes with time)
4. A category tree is available.


Future work
1. Validate method: Using more data on RFID and beacons and data from other retails
2. Relation between customer visit segment vs selling gap(products in basket and products actually purchased).
3. A midway between segment per single visit and using entire history: some X continuous visits.
4. Technical contribution: Use association rules instead of clustering
